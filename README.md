# Project Brutality for gzdoom
This is the primary repository for collaborative efforts between Doom developers on Project Brutality.
This is the bleeding-edge version that is constantly being developed on, and not meant in any way shape or form to be representative of the final version of the mod.

## Running
### Quick start (PB only) 
Download repository as a ZIP file and drag it over gzdoom.exe.
### Running addons
When loading more than just PB, It is highly recommended you use a Front-end Launcher, such as [ZDL](https://github.com/lcferrum/qzdl/releases), [DoomRunner](https://github.com/Youda008/DoomRunner/releases), or [SSGL](https://github.com/FreaKzero/ssgl-doom-launcher/releases)

## Feedback and Bug Reporting
While we would love to hear your opinions and ideas, Issues are reserved for bug reports only. Please make sure that the bug is with the mod itself and not due to any add-ons. The team is not responsible for any addons. Even if the add-on is made by a member of the dev team, it is not our resposibility to fix it, but instead is upto the add-on's creator on whether or not they fix it. Also make sure the issue has not already been posted.

Any suggestions, opinions, or questions should be posted on the discord server. Don't forget to check the rules and faq channels, as well as each channel's pins and description.

##### NOTE: MOTION BLUR ON SPRITES IS AN ARTISTIC CHOICE, NOT LAZINESS. NO WE WILL NOT CHANGE IT.

## Add-ons and Mods
Looking for add-ons or a place to share your personal PB add-on, the discord server has you covered. Just please respect other modders and use proper modder's etiquette.
- If possible, ask for permission. If they say no, respect their decision.
- In cases where the modder is not around or available to ask, be sure to credit them. If the modder is unknown but not you, do not claim it as your own.
- If the modder asks you to remove their stuff from your add-on, Please do so.
- add-ons should be made for the master branch to avoid confussion.

### If the Dev team asks you to remove something using mod resources, please do so without issue.
